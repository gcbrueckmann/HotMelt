# What Is HotMelt?

HotMelt is a lightweight framework for implementing model-view-controller semantics. That means that HotMelt will help you bootstrap a website or web service in no time.

# How Mature Is HotMelt?

HotMelt is currently used in production, and the features already implemented should work as advertised. But while HotMelt is meant to stay lightweight, there are still a few features on the to-do list, e.g.:

- [Composer][composer] support for easier setup
- Automagic support for relationships in the [ORM layer][orm]

# Where Do I Go from Here?

If you want to start playing with HotMelt, head over to the [README file](https://github.com/gcbrueckmann/HotMelt/blob/master/README.md) for setup instructions. [Browse the documentation][docs] to learn more about the topics covered above, or [check out the source][source] at GitHub, if you’re into the gory details.

# Who Are the Authors?

The HotMelt project has been initiated by [Georg C. Brückmann][gcb] but is open to new contributors. Feel free to [fork the source](https://github.com/gcbrueckmann/HotMelt/fork) to experiment and send us a pull request when you want to contribute bugfixes, improvements, or new features.
